The Koch curve is a fractal that looks something like the FigureÂ above. To draw a Koch curve with length $x$, all you have to do is

1.  Draw a Koch curve with length $x/3$.

2.  Turn left 60 degrees.

3.  Draw a Koch curve with length $x/3$.

4.  Turn right 120 degrees.

5.  Draw a Koch curve with length $x/3$.

6.  Turn left 60 degrees.

7.  Draw a Koch curve with length $x/3$.

The exception is if $x$ is less than 3: in that case, you can just draw a straight line with length $x$.

1.  Write a function called <span>koch</span> that takes a turtle and a length as parameters, and that uses the turtle to draw a Koch curve with the given length.

2.  Write a function called <span>snowflake</span> that draws three Koch curves to make the outline of a snowflake.

3.  The Koch curve can be generalized in several ways. See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake> for examples and implement your favorite.
